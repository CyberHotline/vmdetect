# VMDetect
VM detect is a go library that tries to decide whether it is running inside a virtual machine.

Malware analysts can use this if they want to check if malware can detect their virtual environment or not.

## Features
- Checks for the existence of registry keys created by VM platforms
- Checks for applications/files created by VM platforms
- Checks running processes for known VM processes
- Checks registered services on the device for known VM services
- Extendible -> All the checks that are performed, are stored in the [vmdetect_data.json](https://github.com/CyberHotline/vmdetect/blob/main/vmdetect_data.json) if you want to add new artifacts to check for, it is as simple as editing the JSON file
- Automatic -> All you have to do is run the executable, it will download the latest JSON file available, and log all findings in the current working directory
- Uses the power of go routines
- Checks suspicious user desktop for lack of files (COMING SOON)
- Checks the CPUID and other hardware artifacts (COMING SOON)
- Checks running processes for analysis tools that might indicate a virtual environment (COMING SOON)

## Platform Support

  - VirtualBox
  - VMware
With support for more platforms coming soon!
